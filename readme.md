This is an early prototype for what will eventually become an interactive mapping tool for the Spore galaxy. The data comes from `stars.db`, which is where the game stores information about all generated star systems.

## Controls

* Arrow keys to move the view
* +/- to zoom in and out
* Space to reset the view

Binary star systems will be visible at 16x zoom, and the name of each star will appear at 32x zoom.
